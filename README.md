# INTERGRATED CIRCUIT TERM PROJECT

## Objective
The fundamental objective of this term's laboratory exercise is to familiarize students with the principles of 
engineering design thinking, a process through which a holistic solution is conceived to address tangible, 
real-world issues. It is anticipated that students will leverage their accrued knowledge from diverse course 
units to effectively realize the objectives set forth in the term lab project.
